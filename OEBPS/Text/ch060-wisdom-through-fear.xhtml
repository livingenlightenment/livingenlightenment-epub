      <h1>Wisdom through Fear</h1>

      <p>
        If a child is afraid of the dark, we say, ‘Don’t be afraid, you should
        be brave.’ When you say this, you are teaching the child that the fear
        he is feeling should not be felt. But the child cannot do anything if
        the fear arises in him. So now he tries to force himself to feel brave
        by suppressing the fear. This is how the child learns to suppress the
        natural emotion of fear. His body is trembling with fear but he resists
        the fear in order to prove he is brave.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead, if you allow the child to accept the fear and explore the
        darkness that is causing him fear, the child will go through the
        darkness and the fear completely. The fear will automatically drop from
        him because his own experience would have shown him that the fear has no
        solid existence.
