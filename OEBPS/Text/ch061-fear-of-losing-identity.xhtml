      <h1>Fear of losing identity</h1>

      <p>
        The biggest fear human beings have is the fear of losing their identity.
        Even the fear of losing one’s life is not as great as the fear of losing
        the identity. The fear of losing your identity is much worse than the
        fear of death.
