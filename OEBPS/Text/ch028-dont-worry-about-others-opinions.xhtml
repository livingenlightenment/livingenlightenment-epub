      <h1>Don’t Worry about others’ opinions</h1>

      <p>
        Another major cause for worry is when we constantly try to conform to
        another’s opinion of us. The funny thing is that while we are worried
        about others’ opinions of us, they are worried about our opinion of
        them!
      </p>

      <p>
        Society conditions us to worry about others’ opinions all the time. That
        is the problem.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you are worried about what other people think, you unconsciously
        weaken your efforts in whatever it is you are doing. You divert a major
        part of your energy toward suffering and worry.
      </p>

      <p>
        Why do you worry about others’ appreciation? Don’t bother. Just do
        anything totally and to the best of your ability. Leave it at that,
        that’s all. Only then will what you do be the best that you are capable
        of. In the end, you are your only stronghold. You should be clear from
        the beginning that you are your only stronghold. Then there is no need
        to worry about what others think of you.
