      <p>
        Let me give you a simple meditation technique to drop worry and become
        pleasant all the time. This is a meditation to tune yourself to bliss.
        It can be practiced anywhere, any time, even continuously, twenty four
        hours a day
      </p>

      <p>
        Just continuously visualize that you are inhaling and exhaling bliss and
        light. Visualize prana<sup

          ><a href="#there-is-nothing-to-worry-meditation-1">1</a></sup
        >, the life giving energy, going in and out of you with each breath.
        Prana is energy and bliss. It is the energy that enters and leaves us
        through air, which it uses as the vehicle for entry into our system. Air
        carries prana into you. Life continues in you because of prana.
      </p>

      <p>
        So whenever you inhale and exhale, visualize yourself inhaling and
        exhaling blissful light energy. Feel that your whole body is a beanbag
        filled with light. You automatically start radiating bliss instead of
        worry and irritation. Worry is dissolved. You start radiating love and
        bliss continuously.
