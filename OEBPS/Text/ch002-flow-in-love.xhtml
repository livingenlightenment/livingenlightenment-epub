      <p>
        Psychology explains that thoughts arise in the brain, and emotions from
        the heart. Irrespective of where they arise from, thoughts and emotions
        are inseparable. Ancient scriptures say that thoughts create us. So do
        emotions. We become what our emotions are. Managing our emotions is
        crucial to transforming our lives.
