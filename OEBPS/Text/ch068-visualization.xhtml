      <p>
        A very powerful way of overcoming fear is to visualize going through
        that fear as clearly as you can. The beauty with this technique is that
        it can be used when you are not in the fear situation, when you are calm
        and able to handle yourself.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can sit by yourself and visualize the situation that causes fear.
        Feel clearly the fear coming up in you, face the fear with deep
        awareness. If you suffer, if your body feels uncomfortable, it is fine.
        Don’t suppress the fear, just allow it to happen. When you experience
        something completely, you stop the process.
