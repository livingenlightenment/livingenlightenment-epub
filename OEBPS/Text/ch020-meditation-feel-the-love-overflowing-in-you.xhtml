      <h1>Meditation - feel the Love overflowing in you</h1>

      <p>Sit down comfortably by yourself and close your eyes.</p>

      <p>
        Focus on your heart region. Exclude everything else. Focus only on the
        heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        Visualize your heart as an endless reservoir from where blessings can
        flow.
      </p>

      <p>Feel every heartbeat deeply. Let every beat resound throughout you.</p>

      <p>Between the heartbeats, feel the energy of love happening.</p>

      <p>
        In the deepest parts of your body, mind and soul, the love energy is
        waiting to be acknowledged.
      </p>

      <p>
        Invite the love energy of the heart to flow and fill these deepest parts
        of your body, mind and soul.
      </p>

      <p>Slowly open your eyes.</p>
